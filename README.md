## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Task Management (`/home`)
- Users can **add**, **delete**, and **mark tasks as completed**.
- Real-time timers show elapsed time for ongoing tasks.
- Duration for completed tasks is shown in hours, minutes, and seconds.

### 2. Authentication
- **Register** and **Login** to manage your personal tasks.
- **Logout** to end your session securely.

### 3. Auto-Typing Input
- The input field suggests random tasks that automatically type themselves in with a smooth animation, and users can take over once focused.

### 4. Dark/Light Mode
- Toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**, with your selection saved in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.
